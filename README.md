### Nick Charvat, Sabrina Kuah, Kulveer Brar, Juhwan Moon, Mandeep Dhillon

## Overview

RobDemGood is a mock trading app written in React Native using Expo. It uses Firebase for authentication, FinnHub.io for trading data, Express and MongoDB.

#### Features: 
Users are able to: 
- login/register 
- search for a stock symbol
- view stock's history 
- buy or sell a stock
- add a stock to their watchlist
- monitor portofolio's market value and profits/losses
- platform-specific navigation: bottom tabs for iOS devices and drawer navigation for Android devices.

This project was completed remotely over five days. Our team simulated an Agile workflow by discussing milestones and holding daily standups. Tools we used for productivity include: Git, Kanban project board, Slack and Zoom.

## Prototype

We used Figma and a TradeStation template for UI inspiration.

## Installation Instructions
